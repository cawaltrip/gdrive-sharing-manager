# Ludo Media
A management tool to automatically create a personalized upload folder for Ludo concert media.  Then facilitates merging the new files back into the main folder.  Really this was just an excuse to practice working with the Google Drive API.

## TODO
- [x] Fix project/build scripts so that they work both in PyCharm IDE and when installing wheel.
  - [x] Including credential & token files.
- [ ] Automatically share folder with user.
- [ ] Don't use hardcoded folder values so that other people can use it.
- [ ] Determine if files with same names are identical files and don't copy over if so.
- [ ] Update to Google Drive API v3.
